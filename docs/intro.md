# Introduction to Input

Input is a simple app for Android phones and tablets ideal for surveys out in the field.

This is the typical workflow when using Input:

1. Prepare data and a project in QGIS - see [Project configuration](project_config.md)
2. Load data from desktop to the mobile device - see [Data Sync](data_sync.md)
3. Use Input on the phone/tablet to view, edit and/or capture data - see [Using Input](using_input.md)
4. Load changes from the mobile device back to the desktop - see [Data Sync](data_sync.md)
