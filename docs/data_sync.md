# Data Synchronization

Getting your QGIS project to the mobile device and getting newly captured data off the device back
to the desktop computer for further processing are two important steps in the workflow when using Input.

# Option 1: Manual Download/Upload

This can be done by connecting your mobile device to the computer and copying data files to/from the device.
Once your Android phone or tablet is recognized by the operating system after connecting it using USB cable,
you can use file browser to copy files. On Android devices, data are stored in `INPUT/projects` directory.

# Option 2: Automatic Download/Upload with Mergin

Because manual upload and download of data is often time consuming, tedious and error-prone process,
we recommend using Mergin service to synchronize your projects and data between computer and mobile devices.

On desktop computer you can easily register to Mergin, create a new project and upload your data.
Within Input app, you just log in to Mergin to see your projects and download them. Once a project has been
downloaded, it is available offline in your mobile device. If you do some editing or capture some new data,
Input will automatically find out and offer upload of data back to Mergin. Then you can download your updated
project back to the desktop computer whenever needed.
